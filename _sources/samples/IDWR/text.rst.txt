Sample from the Indian Daily Weather Reports
============================================

Over the colonial period, daily weather reports were published for stations in the Indian sub-continent and images of those reports have been taken from  copies in the Met Office archives and the NOAA archives. Some of theme are being digitised, at the University of Geissen, as part of the `Climate Science for Service Partnership China <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/collaboration/cssp-china>`_, but most remain undigitised.
