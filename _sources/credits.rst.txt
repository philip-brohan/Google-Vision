This is not a paper, or a report. Instead it borrows a standard approach from the modern software industry: it's a GitHub repository. The repository contains a collection of `reStructuredText <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_ which can be converted, using the `Sphinx documentation generator <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx_(documentation_generator)>`_, into a website or PDF document.
