Sample from the UK Second Order Stations Books
==============================================

The records of the `Stations of the Second Order <http://brohan.org/UK-digitisation/sources/second_order.html>`_ are available as `digital images from the National Met Library and Archive <https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/deliverableUnit_b08db4f8-6a00-487d-b911-d7f5ef52bcc5/>`_. They are a high priority candidate for an automatic transcription system as they are printed tables of data, with high-quality images available.
